# Liquidation-Manifest-Price-Finder-through-Ebay

**** EBAY API-KEY EXPIRED ****

Trying to sell liquidated items from Amazon on ebay.
Too time consuming to look up recently sold listings for a specified items,
so I made a little script that 
1. takes the manifest from liquidations.com
2. searches ebay through its api for recently sold listings
3. returning a csv of the listing and recently sold price.
    a. if no listing price found, "unknown"
